Here is the team report for our group MediaWiki for school!

**Our team name:** WikiNets


**Service:** We'll run a MediaWiki site deployment on a server and give detail on all required ports and services.


**Group roles:** Here are some roles below with a bit of info on how each person will go ahead with them.

Research:
Kasia
For research we'll look into installation and deployment.

Documentation:

We'll make sure to have a good list of ports and protocols and what they do.

Testing:

Support:

Ron
We'll work with each group member depending on which items above need contributions.


**Communication:** We'll keep in touch both through weekly/bi-weekly meetings and also a continuous group text chat.


**Tasks needed to build:** We are planning to rent a VPS or similar server to host and install the MediaWiki. We'll run this on a Linux server.


**Protocols being used:** We'll be using TCP/IP and HTTP(port 80)/HTTPS(port 443) as our first options and will likely add more as we discover them.
